However, this can lead to cluttered figures which obscures important variation in the data. To avoid clutter we can create faceted figures where mutliple subplots of the same type are generated, which share axes, and different subsets (groups) of the data are rendered on each subplot.</p> <p>Wilke (2019) distinguish between faceted figures and compound figures. Compound figures are multiple figure types (e.g. scatter plots, histograms, maps), possibly of different datasets, combined into one figure. A key feature of a compound figure is that the subplots do not need to be arranged in a regular grid. The figures above with violin and box plots aligned on the margins of a scatter plot are examples of compound figures.</p> <p>In contrast, facet plots consist of subplots of the same type, showing subsets of the same dataset, and are arranged on a regular grid. You might see the term trellis or lattice plots used to describe facet plots. To ensure correct interpretation of faceted figures it is important that the axes on all plots share the same range and scalings.</p> <p>Let's create a faceted figure that shows the relationship between crop yield and the normalised difference yellowness index (NDYI) side-by-side. The NDYI is a spectral index computed from remote sensing data as a mathematical combination of green and blue reflectance values. Higher NDYI values are associated with a yellower land surface. The NDYI is often used to monitor canola flowering.</p> <p>We can use the <code>facet_row</code> parameter to align subplots on separate rows or the <code>facet_col</code> parameter to align the subplots on separate columns.

Often a light colour (e.g. white) is used as the mid-point of a diverging colour scale with gradients of intensifying colour away from this mid-point. A common example of diverging colour scales are climate or weather anomalies where dry or hot years are represented with red colours and wet and cool years are represented with blue colours. Average conditions are often a pale red, pale blue, or white.</p> <p>Plotly also provides a range of diverging colour palettes we can use:</p>"},{"location":"notebooks/week-2_1/#qualitative-palettes","title":"Qualitative palettes\u00b6","text":"<p>Qualitative (or discrete) colour scales should be used to represent groups or categorical data (i.e. data where there is no logical ordering). Thus, qualitative colour scales should not represent gradients of light to dark or use colours that can be interpreted as having an implied ordering. Often, it is sensible to select colours that relate to the category (e.g. on land cover maps using green for vegetated categories, blue for water etc.).</p>"}]}

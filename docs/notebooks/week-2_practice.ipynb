    "# Week 2 - Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains exercises related to week 2's content on generating interactive visualisations using Plotly Express. These exercises are based on an Our World in Data article: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/yields-habitat-loss\" target=\"_blank\">*To protect the world’s wildlife we must improve crop yields – especially across Africa*</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "This article contains several visualisations, based on the paper by <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00656-5\" target=\"_blank\">Williams et al. (2020)</a>, which illustrate that projected cropland expansion to meet future demands for food will result in substantial habitat loss, threats to biodiversity, and extinction. In part, this is due to growing populations in Africa where i) crop yields are low and so increasing the area under cultivation is required to generate more food, and ii) habitat for many key species is located. They also explore potential scenarios for meeting demand for food that avert the need for cropland expansion. Of the scenarios they explore, closing yield gaps in Africa looks most promising and with potential food security and economic co-benefits. \n",

    "These exercises demonstrate how we can use data visualisations and animations to combine datasets from a range of subject areas (population, agriculture, biodiversity), explore them, and identify solutions to complex problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, these datasets highlight the challenge of meeting food demand while protecting the habitat of many species under business-as-usual agricultural and demographic scenarios. However, visualising this data spatially illustrates how closing crop yield gaps in Africa could realise many benefits simultaneously of meeting food demand, achieving food security and development goals, and protecting habitats from conversion to cropland. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise also demonstrates the importance of data visualisations as a communication tool (see the Our World in Data article: <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/yields-habitat-loss\" target=\"_blank\">*To protect the world’s wildlife we must improve crop yields – especially across Africa*</a> as a good example of this ). Data visualisations can be used to summarise the complexity of big datasets to tell an important story to a range of audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, think about all the datasets used in these exercises: global historical and projected population time-series, global crop yield time-series, data on cropland area, habitats for species, diets, and food waste. These datasets are derived from a range of underlying data sources and models. Considerable skills in (spatial) data processing and analysis are required to generate all these underlying datasets that permit analyses such as that in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00656-5\" target=\"_blank\">Williams et al.

    "## Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "We have mentioned a few times that Python programs comprise objects. We will now define what an object is and how the concept of an object relates to the data types and structures we have looked at above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is a more general concept in programming. An object in a computer program has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* properties or attributes (data)\n",
    "* behaviour (methods or functions that do things with object data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects provide a way to add structure to a program by combining related data and behaviours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside the built-in data types and structures, we can create objects that are customised and useful for specific tasks or representing specific kinds of data or real-world problems. Often, custom data types will combine the built-in data types and structures, or other custom objects, to create objects that represent more complex concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a definition of an object. The class defines the object's data and methods. An object is an instance of a class in our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object's data (sometimes called its properties or attributes) can be built-in Python data types or structures or custom classes. An object's methods are functions that can be used to transform data or implement other behaviour that is relevant to the object. For example, an object representing a table is more complex than a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### pandas `DataFrame`s\n",
    "\n",
    "For most use cases there are existing classes that have already been developed and can be used in our programs. Keeping with the idea of working with tabular data, pandas provides a `DataFrame` class to work with tabular data. In our Python program to visualise the crop yield data we read the tabular data stored in CSV files into pandas `DataFrames`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pandas `DataFrame` is a far more comprehensive class for handling tabular data. Compared to our small example of using a dictionary object to store tabular data, a pandas `DataFrame` implements well defined data structures for tabular data and provides a suite of useful methods (functions) for analysing and processing tabular data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `DataFrame` Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `DataFrame` is a data structure for \"Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data\". It has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* data - the tabular data stored in the data frame \n",
    "* index - the row index (row labels)\n",
    "* columns - the column headers\n",
    "* dtype - the data types of each column\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/data-analysis-3300-3003/figs/raw/main/week-1-pandas-data-frame.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A pandas `DataFrame` stores its values in rows and columns. There is a list of column headers (which should provide a helpful description of what kind of data is in each column) and a row index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in columns are pandas `Series` objects. A `Series` is an array of the same type data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas `DataFrame` object stores a range of properties that are useful for working with tabular data. You can look up the documentation for a `DataFrame` <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The properties listed **do not** have parentheses after their name `()`. Let's look at the properties under *attributes and underlying data*. We can see the `DataFrame` has a `values` property which is the actual data values in the table and a `shape` property which tells us the shape of the table (number of rows and columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/data-analysis-3300-3003/figs/raw/main/week-1-pandas-docs-labelled.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time we will explore classes using their documentation websites. Let's read a CSV file into a pandas `DataFrame` and explore its properties."

    "### Methods and functions\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, the `print()` function takes data as an argument and prints it on your display as text. For example, `print(\"hello\")` would print `hello` on your screen. The `df = pd.read_csv(\"a_csv_file.csv\")` is a function within the pandas package the takes in a path to a CSV file as an argument and reads the data from that file into a `DataFrame` referenced by `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are functions that belong to a class. For example, the `mean()` method of the pandas `DataFrame` can be called by accessing it via a `DataFrame()` object (e.g `df.mean()`). Methods often provide functionality related to the \"topic\" of the class they're associated with. For example, `DataFrame` methods provide functions related to working tabular data in `DataFrame` objects; dictionary objects have specialist methods geared for retrieving and setting data elements in dictionaries; string objects have methods for manipulating text (e.g. the `lower()` of a string object will convert all text characters to lower case). \n",
    "\n",
    "The general pattern for executing a function / method is:\n",
    "\n",

    "3. The function returns the result of operating on the data \n",

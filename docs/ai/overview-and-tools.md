# Using AI for spatial and agricultural data analysis

## Overview

This is a short guide to using AI tools and AI generated content for spatial and agricultural data analysis tasks. It provides an overview of different AI tools that can be used for GIS, programming, literature review and general learning and topic understanding tasks. 

This guide covers:

* [Overview of AI tools](#ai-tools): an overview of AI tools for working with text, coding, images, video, audio, literature and search. 
* [Example uses of AI tools](example-uses.md): a selection of examples using AI tools for GIS, programming, data visualisation, topic understanding, literature search and reviews and more. 
* [Prompt engineering](prompt-engineering.md): the quality of prompt you provide to AI tools determines the quality of generated response. This guide provides an overview of best practice and techniques for generating high quality prompts. 
* [Responsible AI](responsible-use-of-ai.md): notes and resources on responsible use of AI tools. 
* [Verification and quality checking](verifying-and-checking-ai-responses.md): tips for checking the quality, accuracy and factuality of AI generated content. 


This is a fast moving field, so these notes just scratch the surface and they’re almost certain to be dated when you read this. 

There is a skew in the examples towards AI tools provided by Google, the only reason for this is that they’re the tools I’m more familiar using. However, the concepts and techniques discussed here should generalise for use with other AI platforms. 

These notes focus on freely available AI tools with the intention that they’re broadly accessible; however, in places suggestions for using paid tools are provided.

## AI tools

### LLMs: text generation and chat interfaces

Large language models (LLMs) are the engine of many generative AI tools. LLMs are trained for next word prediction on massive text datasets and can be fine-tuned for a range of other tasks (e.g. code generation or question and answering). Examples of LLMs include Google’s Gemini models, OpenAI’s family of models and Meta’s Llama models. 

These models can be accessed via chat interfaces in their apps or websites:

* <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini</a>
* <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>
* <a href="https://www.meta.ai" target="_blank">Llama</a> 
* <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Copilot</a>
* <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude" target="_blank">Claude</a>

These models can be used for a range of text generation and writing tasks:

* Question-answer
* Instruction generation
* Text summarisation
* Writing feedback
* Code generation

### Search

LLMs are increasingly integrated with search. When you prompt the LLM an online search will be conducted and used to generate your response. This can improve the quality of the response (via grounding and reducing the risk of hallucinations), make online content more accessible (e.g. by summarising lengthy content and dense web pages or synthesising content from multiple resources) and help you verify the factuality of the response (by following links).

The following have freely available search integrated with LLMs:

* <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini (Flash 2.0)</a>
* <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai" target="_blank">Perplexity</a> 
* <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> 

The prompt and response below illustrate the benefits of integrating LLMs with search. The response has synthesised information from several web pages documenting John Deere's Operations Centre, identified relevant URLs (API endpoints) to request data from, provided links for you to verify the responses or for further research and provided a Python code example. Reflect on how long it would take you to do this by manually searching for relevant information in the John Deere Operations Centre documentation and then developing the associated Python code. 

!!! note "Prompt"
    How can I download as-applied herbicide application and seeding data from John Deere's Operations Centre? What API endpoints do I need to use? Can you provide a Python code example to download seeding data?
    ??? note "Response (Perplexity)"
        To download as-applied herbicide application and seeding data from John Deere's Operations Centre, you should use the Field Operations API. This API provides access to data collected during field work, including application and seeding operations[1].

        API Endpoints

        1. List Field Operations:
        GET https://sandboxapi.deere.com/platform/organizations/{orgId}/fields/{fieldId}/fieldOperations

        2. View a Field Operation:
        GET https://sandboxapi.deere.com/platform/fieldOperations/{operationId}

        These endpoints allow you to retrieve metadata, totals, map images, and point-level data for field operations[1].

        Python Code Example for Downloading Seeding Data

        Here's a Python code example to retrieve seeding data using the Field Operations API:

        ```python
        import requests
        from oauthlib.oauth2 import BackendApplicationClient
        from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session

        # OAuth2 setup
        client_id = 'your_client_id'
        client_secret = 'your_client_secret'
        token_url = 'https://authentication.deere.com/oauth2/token'

        client = BackendApplicationClient(client_id=client_id)
        oauth = OAuth2Session(client=client)
        token = oauth.fetch_token(token_url=token_url, client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)

        # API request parameters
        org_id = 'your_organization_id'
        field_id = 'your_field_id'
        url = f'https://sandboxapi.deere.com/platform/organizations/{org_id}/fields/{field_id}/fieldOperations'

        headers = {
            'Accept': 'application/vnd.deere.axiom.v3+json',
            'x-deere-signature': ''  # Leave empty for the first request
        }

        params = {
            'fieldOperationType': 'SEEDING',
            'embed': 'measurementTypes'
        }

        # Make the API request
        response = oauth.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)

        if response.status_code == 200:
            seeding_data = response.json()
            print("Seeding Data:", seeding_data)
            
            # Update x-deere-signature for subsequent requests
            new_signature = response.headers.get('x-deere-signature')
            if new_signature:
                headers['x-deere-signature'] = new_signature
        else:
            print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
        ```

        To use this code:
        1. Replace `'your_client_id'` and `'your_client_secret'` with your John Deere API credentials.
        2. Replace `'your_organization_id'` and `'your_field_id'` with the appropriate IDs.
        3. Install the required Python packages: `requests`, `oauthlib`, and `requests_oauthlib`.

        This code will authenticate with the John Deere API, retrieve seeding operations for the specified field, and print the data. You can modify the `fieldOperationType` parameter to 'APPLICATION' to retrieve herbicide application data instead[1].

        Remember to handle pagination, error checking, and implement proper data processing for production use.

        Answer from Perplexity: pplx.ai/share

    !!! tip "LLM respones are probabilistic - always check them"
        The first rule of working with LLMs is to check their responses. LLMs are a tool to help you be more efficient, an assistant to help you problem solve and an aid to bounce ideas off and clarify your thinking. *They are not good at doing your job for you. They are not guaranteed to generate correct and useful answers. They are good at helping you become better at doing your job.* 

        LLMs generate their responses probabilistically, you may get different responses to the same prompt. These responses will vary in quality, relevance and sometimes with the contextual information you've already provided in your chat session. 
        
        Look at the three responses below generated by Gemini to the same prompt. From a cursory take, response 2 is very generic, has not provided specific details on how to use the John Deere Operations Centre APIs and has not provided a Python example. Responses 1 and 3 look like better first starts for solving the problem providing more detail on API endpoints and a Python example. However, there are still inconsistencies such as suggesting using different API URLs.

        * You should always verify and check the responses provided by LLMs
        * Providing contextual information and more specific instructions can help LLMs generate more accurate and relevant responses
        * For search tasks, consider including relevant URLs in the prompt (e.g. the API docs)
        * For coding tasks, iterate with the LLM to generate a test example (e.g. a dummy dataset)

    ??? note "Response 1 (Gemini 2.0 Flash)"
        Obtaining as-applied herbicide application and seeding data from John Deere's Operations Center programmatically involves utilizing the John Deere Developer Platform and its APIs. Here's a breakdown of the process and key considerations:

        Python Code Example (General Outline):

        Providing a fully functional Python code example is complex due to the authentication process and the nuances of the John Deere API. However, here's a general outline to illustrate the process:

        ```python
        import requests
        import json

        # Replace with your API credentials
        access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
        organization_id = "YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID"
        field_id = "YOUR_FIELD_ID"

        # API endpoint (example)
        api_url = f"https://api.deere.com/platform/organizations/{organization_id}/fields/{field_id}/operations"

        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
            "Accept": "application/json",
        }

        params = {
            "operationType": "seeding", #or application
            "startDate": "2023-01-01",
            "endDate": "2023-12-31",
        }

        try:
            response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=params)
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes
            data = response.json()
            print(json.dumps(data, indent=4)) #prints the json data in a readable format.

            # Process the data (e.g., extract seeding data)
            # ...

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
        ```

        Important Notes:

        * This code is a basic example and requires adaptation to your specific needs.
        * You'll need to install the requests library: `pip install requests`

        I hope this information is helpful.

    ??? note "Response 3 (Gemini 2.0 Flash)"
        It's important to understand that accessing precise, real-time data from John Deere's Operations Center requires adherence to their developer guidelines and API usage. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this, combining general API principles with specific John Deere information:

        Key API Areas:

        Field Operations API:

        * This API is crucial for retrieving as-applied data, including seeding and herbicide application information. https://developer.deere.com/dev-docs/field-operations
        
        It allows access to:
        
        * Metadata about field operations. https://developer.deere.com/dev-docs/field-operations
        * Totals for areas worked and amounts applied/planted. https://developer.deere.com/dev-docs/field-operations
        * Map images.
        * Point-level data (often available as shapefile exports). https://developer.deere.com/dev-docs/field-operations
        
        Map Layers API:
        
        * This API is important for getting the visual representation of the data, and can be used in conjunction with the field operations API.
        
        Products API:
        
        * This API is used to get information about the products used in the field, like the specific type of seed or herbicide. https://developer.deere.com/dev-docs/products

        Permissions:
        
        * Ensure you have the necessary permissions within the John Deere Operations Center to access the data.
        
        Python Example (Conceptual):

        ```python
        import requests
        import json

        # Replace with your actual credentials
        access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
        field_id = "YOUR_FIELD_ID"

        # API endpoint (example - refer to John Deere docs)
        api_url = f"https://developer.deere.com/maplayers/v2/organizations/fields/{field_id}/operations"

        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
            "Accept": "application/json",
        }

        params = {
            "operationType": "seeding", #or "application"
            "startDate": "2024-01-01",
            "endDate": "2024-12-31",
        }

        try:
            response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, params=params)
            response.raise_for_status()  # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
            data = response.json()
            print(json.dumps(data, indent=4)) #prints the json response.
            # Process the 'data' JSON to extract seeding information
            # ... (code to parse and handle data) ...

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
        ```

        Key Notes about the Python example:

        * This is a basic example. You'll need to adapt it to the specific John Deere API endpoints and data structures.
        * Error handling is essential.
        * You will need to install the requests library. pip install requests
        * Geopandas is very useful for working with the geospatial data that is often returned. pip install geopandas
        
        I strongly advise you to carefully review the official John Deere developer documentation for the most accurate and current API information.

### Thinking and reasoning models

The latest AI models (at the time of writing in February 2025) are being released with <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/Kseniase/testtimecompute" target="_blank">"thinking" or "reasoning" versions</a>. When generating a response to your prompt, these models use a "thinking" process where they break a problem down into a series of discrete steps, explore different options and explain the process used to create the response.

The following are models with "thinking" or "reasoning" capabilities:

* <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini (Flash Thinking 2.0)</a>
* <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai" target="_blank">Perplexity</a> 
* <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>

*Note, with Perplexity you can access ChatGPT's o3-mini, their most advanced reasoning model as of February 2025, with the free account.*

These models are well suited to larger and more complex reasoning problems; "thinking" models are useful for generating responses to problems that comprise several steps with multiple possible solutions. For each step, the model needs to reason and consider which solution is best. 

"Thinking" models are good candidates for generating templates and examples of end-to-end geospatial workflows that encompass several sub-tasks such as data processing, exploratory analysis, spatial analysis operations and reporting and data visualisation. A "thinking" model can focus on each of these steps in-turn. Look at the below example generating a workflow to interpolate soil samples to create a continuous spatial surface; it's generated detailed notes and points for you to consider for each stage in this digital soil mapping task.

!!! tip "Using the responses of "thinking" models"
    <a href="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Gemini Flash Thinking 2.0</a> and <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai" target="_blank">Perplexity</a> report the model's "thinking" steps when problem solving and generating your response. Use this as a template for your own computational thinking and problem solving where you break large complex problems down into discrete tasks.

    "Thinking" models generate detailed responses with an explanation and justification for each step. Use the response as an entry point to critically and analytically consider the problem and your solution. Do you agree with the model's justifications and choices? Are there aspects the model has not considered? Has the model considered things you had not thought of? 
    
!!! note "Prompt"
    As a senior geospatial analyst, can you develop a workflow to interpolate a sample of soil properties, collected at various locations within a field, to create a continuous spatial surface?

    Can you provide an explanation and justification for each step in the workflow and accompanying Python code for each step?

    ??? note "Response (Gemini Flash Thinking 2.0)"
        **Thinking trace**
        Here's a breakdown of the thinking process to construct the workflow for soil property interpolation:

        Deconstruct the Request:  Identify the core needs. The user wants:

        * A workflow for interpolating soil properties.
        * Continuous spatial surface as output.
        * Justification for each step.
        * Python code for each step.
        * Senior Geospatial Analyst perspective (implying best practices and consideration of choices).
        * Core Geospatial Analysis Task:  Recognize this is a spatial interpolation problem.  Recall standard interpolation techniques and their suitability for soil data.  Think about common methods: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Kriging, Spline, Nearest Neighbor.

        Workflow Structure - Start with the Big Picture: A workflow is sequential. What are the high-level stages in any geospatial analysis like this?  Generally:

        * Data Input & Preparation.
        * Method Selection & Application.
        * Output & Evaluation.
        * Refinement/Iteration.
        * Data Input & Preparation - Break Down the First Stage: What's needed to use sample data?

        Data Input: Need the sample data itself (soil property values and locations). What format? CSV, Shapefile, GeoJSON are common. Decision: Start with CSV as it's easily manipulated in Python and often a common starting point.
        
        Data Exploration (EDA): Crucial. Can't just jump to interpolation. Need to understand the data before applying methods. What to look for? 
        
        * Basic stats (min, max, mean, std dev).
        * Histograms, boxplots (distribution).
        * Spatial distribution plot (are samples clustered, evenly spaced?).
        * Trend analysis (directional trends in the data? May affect interpolation method).
        * Outlier detection (anomalous values that could skew interpolation). Important note: Outliers in soil data can be real, not just errors, so handle with care.
        * Data Quality Check: Ensure data integrity - missing values, coordinate system. Decision: Address missing values by either removing or potentially imputing (but keep it simple for this workflow; removing for now is reasonable first step). Ensure coordinate system is defined/consistent.
        * Method Selection & Application - The Heart of the Workflow: Now choose the interpolation method.

        Consider Options: IDW is simple, Kriging is geostatistically robust (if assumptions met), Spline is good for smooth surfaces, Nearest Neighbor creates Thiessen polygons (different type of "continuous" surface, maybe less ideal for smooth soil properties).
        
        * Justification for Kriging (as primary): Kriging is often favored for soil data because it considers spatial autocorrelation (soil properties tend to be more similar closer together). It also provides variance estimates (uncertainty). This is a stronger method conceptually than IDW for this application.
        * Justification for IDW (as alternative/comparison): IDW is simpler and faster, good for comparison or when Kriging assumptions are difficult to meet or computationally intensive for large datasets. It's a good "baseline".
        
        Parameterization: Each method has parameters. For Kriging: variogram modeling is key. For IDW: power parameter. Decision: Briefly mention variogram modeling as a key step in Kriging but focus on the conceptual workflow first, then add a note about needing more detailed variogram modeling if actually implementing. For IDW, mention power parameter and how to potentially optimize (though no code for optimization in this initial workflow – keep it focused).
        
        Output & Evaluation - How to Know if it's Good?:  Just interpolating isn't enough. Need to assess the result.

        * Visualization: Essential to see the interpolated surface. Maps are the core output.
        * Validation: Quantitatively assess accuracy. Common methods:
        * Hold-out Validation: Split data into training and validation sets. Interpolate using training, predict at validation locations, compare predicted vs. actual.
        * Cross-validation: Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) is common for geostatistics. Iteratively remove each point, interpolate using the rest, predict at the removed location, compare to actual. Calculate error metrics (RMSE, MAE, etc.).
        * Uncertainty Assessment (for Kriging): Kriging provides variance/standard deviation surfaces. Map these to understand where predictions are more or less certain.
        * Refinement/Iteration - Geospatial Analysis is Often Iterative:  Analysis is rarely perfect on the first try.

        Parameter Tuning: Adjust method parameters (variogram model in Kriging, power in IDW) based on validation results or expert knowledge.
        
        Method Comparison: Compare different interpolation methods (if you tried Kriging, maybe also try IDW, or Spline, etc.) and see which performs best.
        
        Data Re-evaluation: If results are poor, revisit data exploration. Are there outliers, trends not accounted for, data quality issues missed? Could more data collection be beneficial?
        
        Python Code Implementation - Choose Libraries & Keep it Practical:

        * Core Libraries: pandas (data manipulation), numpy (numerical operations), matplotlib & seaborn (plotting), scipy.interpolate (IDW, potentially RBF), geopandas (spatial data handling if using shapefiles, though CSV initially chosen for simplicity), scikit-learn (validation metrics).
        * Geostatistical Libraries: pykrige is a good choice for Kriging in Python. gstools is another option, more comprehensive but potentially steeper learning curve. Decision: Use pykrige as it's relatively focused on Kriging and user-friendly for this kind of workflow demonstration.
        * Code Structure: Break down the code into functions for each step (data loading, EDA, interpolation, validation, visualization) to make it modular and readable.
        * Comments and Explanations: Crucial! Code should be well-commented, and each code block in the workflow needs a clear explanation of what it's doing and why. Justify library choices and function usage.
        
        Senior Geospatial Analyst Perspective - Add the Expert Touch:  Throughout the workflow and justifications, emphasize:

        * Method Choice Rationale: Explain why Kriging (and IDW) are chosen, the strengths and weaknesses.
        * Data Quality Importance: Stress the need for thorough data exploration and quality checks.
        * Validation is Essential: Highlight that interpolation is not just about making a pretty map, but about creating a reliable surface, and validation proves (or disproves) reliability.
        * Context Matters: Remind the user that the "best" workflow depends on the specific data, soil property, and project goals. This workflow is a solid starting point, not a one-size-fits-all solution.
        * Iteration and Refinement: Emphasize that geospatial analysis is iterative.
        * Review and Refine:  After drafting the workflow, review it logically. Does it flow well? Are justifications clear and strong? Is the Python code practical and well-explained?  Are there any missing steps or important considerations?  For example, initially I might forget to explicitly mention coordinate systems in data prep – need to add that. Or I might not have initially included uncertainty assessment from Kriging - important to add.  Ensure the language is appropriate for a "senior geospatial analyst".

        By following these steps – deconstructing the request, thinking about core geospatial concepts, structuring a workflow, detailing each stage with justifications, providing code examples, and adding expert perspective – we can build a comprehensive and helpful answer to the user's request.

        **Final generated response**

        Certainly! As a senior geospatial analyst, developing a robust workflow for interpolating soil properties is a fundamental task with significant implications for precision agriculture, environmental modeling, and land management. Here's a detailed workflow, explanation, justification, and accompanying Python code for each step, designed to create a continuous spatial surface of soil properties from point samples.

        Workflow for Soil Property Interpolation
        This workflow is structured into sequential steps, starting with data preparation and ending with result validation and refinement.

        Data Collection and Input:

        * Explanation: This initial step involves gathering your soil property samples and their corresponding geographic locations. Accurate and representative sampling is crucial for reliable interpolation. The data should include at least:
        * Location Coordinates: Latitude and Longitude (or projected coordinates).
        * Soil Property Value: The measured value of the soil property of interest (e.g., pH, organic matter, nutrient concentration).
        
        Justification: The quality of the input data directly determines the quality of the output surface. Representative sampling ensures that the spatial variability of the soil property is captured adequately. Georeferencing is essential for spatial analysis and interpolation.
        
        Python Code (Illustrative - Data Input from CSV):

        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        import geopandas as gpd
        from shapely.geometry import Point

        # --- Step 1: Data Input ---
        def load_soil_data(csv_filepath):
            """
            Loads soil sample data from a CSV file.

            Args:
                csv_filepath (str): Path to the CSV file.

            Returns:
                geopandas.GeoDataFrame: GeoDataFrame with soil data and geometry.
            """
            try:
                soil_data = pd.read_csv(csv_filepath)
                # Assuming CSV has columns 'Latitude', 'Longitude', and 'Soil_Property'
                # Create geometry column from lat/lon
                geometry = [Point(xy) for xy in zip(soil_data['Longitude'], soil_data['Latitude'])]
                geo_df = gpd.GeoDataFrame(soil_data, crs="EPSG:4326", geometry=geometry) # Assuming WGS84, adjust CRS if needed
                print("Data loaded successfully.")
                return geo_df
            except FileNotFoundError:
                print(f"Error: File not found at {csv_filepath}")
                return None
            except KeyError as e:
                print(f"Error: Missing required columns in CSV: {e}")
                return None

        # Example usage:
        soil_data_gdf = load_soil_data('soil_samples.csv') # Replace 'soil_samples.csv' with your file path

        if soil_data_gdf is not None:
            print(soil_data_gdf.head())
        ```

        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

        * Explanation: Before interpolation, it's essential to understand the characteristics of your soil data. EDA involves:
        * Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, skewness, kurtosis to understand the data distribution.
        * Histograms and Boxplots: Visualize the data distribution to identify normality or skewness and potential outliers.
        * Spatial Distribution Mapping: Plot the sample locations and visualize the soil property values at these locations to get a sense of spatial patterns (e.g., clustering, trends).
        Variography (Optional, but highly recommended for Kriging later): If using Kriging, preliminary variogram analysis can provide insights into spatial autocorrelation.
        
        Justification: EDA helps in:

        * Data Quality Check: Identifying potential errors, outliers, or unusual data points that might need investigation or correction.
        * Understanding Data Distribution: Informing the choice of interpolation method. Some methods are more sensitive to data distribution than others. For instance, Kriging often assumes normality (or transformable to normality).
        * Spatial Pattern Recognition: Guiding the selection of interpolation parameters and helping to understand the underlying spatial processes.
        
        Python Code:

        ```python
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import seaborn as sns
        import numpy as np

        # --- Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ---
        def perform_eda(soil_gdf, property_column='Soil_Property'):
            """
            Performs Exploratory Data Analysis on soil data.

            Args:
                soil_gdf (geopandas.GeoDataFrame): GeoDataFrame with soil data.
                property_column (str): Name of the soil property column.
            """
            if soil_gdf is None:
                print("No data loaded for EDA.")
                return

            print("\n--- Exploratory Data Analysis ---")
            print(f"\nDescriptive Statistics for {property_column}:\n", soil_gdf[property_column].describe())

            plt.figure(figsize=(14, 6))

            # Histogram
            plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
            sns.histplot(soil_gdf[property_column], kde=True)
            plt.title(f'Histogram of {property_column}')

            # Boxplot
            plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
            sns.boxplot(y=soil_gdf[property_column])
            plt.title(f'Boxplot of {property_column}')
            plt.tight_layout()
            plt.show()

            # Spatial Distribution Map
            plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
            geo_plot = soil_gdf.plot(column=property_column, legend=True, markersize=50, cmap='viridis') # Customize cmap as needed
            geo_plot.set_title(f'Spatial Distribution of {property_column}')
            geo_plot.set_axis_off() # Optional: Remove axis ticks and labels
            plt.show()


        perform_eda(soil_data_gdf)
        ```

        Data Preprocessing (Handling Outliers and Trends):

        * Explanation: Based on EDA, you might need to preprocess your data:
        * Outlier Handling: Identify and decide how to treat outliers. Outliers could be genuine extreme values or errors. Decisions might include:
        * Removal: If deemed errors, outliers can be removed (with caution and justification).
        * Capping/Winsorizing: Limit extreme values to a certain percentile.
        * Transformation: Transform data to reduce the influence of outliers (e.g., log transformation).
        * Trend Analysis and Detrending: If EDA reveals a spatial trend (e.g., property values systematically increase from north to south), you might want to detrend the data. This involves:
        * Trend Surface Analysis: Fit a polynomial surface to model the trend.
        * Detrending: Subtract the trend surface from the original data. Interpolation is then performed on the residuals, and the trend is added back to the interpolated surface later.
        
        Justification:
        
        * Outlier Mitigation: Outliers can disproportionately influence some interpolation methods (like IDW) and lead to inaccurate surfaces. Handling them appropriately improves the robustness of the interpolation.
        * Trend Removal: Interpolation methods often assume stationarity (that spatial variability is consistent across the area). Trends violate this assumption. Detrending can improve the performance of methods like Kriging by making the residuals more stationary.
        
        Python Code (Illustrative - Outlier Capping and Simple Detrending):

        ```python
        # --- Step 3: Data Preprocessing ---
        def preprocess_data(soil_gdf, property_column='Soil_Property', outlier_threshold_percentile=99, detrend=False):
            """
            Preprocesses soil data by handling outliers and detrending (optional).

                property_column (str): Name of the soil property column.
                outlier_threshold_percentile (int): Percentile for outlier capping (e.g., 99th percentile).
                detrend (bool): Whether to perform simple detrending (not implemented robustly here, for illustration).

            Returns:
                geopandas.GeoDataFrame: Preprocessed GeoDataFrame.
            """
            if soil_gdf is None:
                print("No data to preprocess.")
                return None

            print("\n--- Data Preprocessing ---")

            # Outlier Capping (example: capping values above 99th percentile)
            threshold_value = np.percentile(soil_gdf[property_column], outlier_threshold_percentile)
            soil_gdf['Processed_Property'] = soil_gdf[property_column].clip(upper=threshold_value) # Create a new processed column
            print(f"Outliers capped above {outlier_threshold_percentile}th percentile (value: {threshold_value:.2f}).")

            # Simple Detrending (Illustrative - Linear Trend based on Longitude)
            if detrend: # This is a very basic example, more robust trend analysis is needed in practice
                X = soil_gdf['Longitude'].values.reshape(-1, 1) # Longitude as predictor
                y = soil_gdf['Processed_Property'].values
                from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

                print("Simple linear detrending performed based on Longitude.")
                property_column = 'Detrended_Property' # Interpolate detrended property
            else:
                soil_gdf['Detrended_Property'] = soil_gdf['Processed_Property'].copy() # Just for consistency if not detrending
                property_column = 'Detrended_Property' # Interpolate capped property if not detrending

            print("Preprocessing completed.")
            return soil_gdf, property_column # Return the processed GeoDataFrame and the column to interpolate

        soil_data_gdf_processed, property_column_to_interpolate = preprocess_data(soil_data_gdf, detrend=False) # Adjust detrend=True to enable simple detrending
        if soil_data_gdf_processed is not None:
            print(soil_data_gdf_processed.head())
        ```

        Interpolation Method Selection and Parameterization:

        * Explanation: Choose an appropriate interpolation method based on data characteristics, desired output, and assumptions. Common methods include:
        * Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW): Simple, deterministic method. Assumes closer points have more influence. Parameters include power parameter (controlling distance decay) and search radius.
        * Kriging: Geostatistical method that considers spatial autocorrelation. More complex but often more accurate for spatially correlated data like soil properties. Requires variogram modeling (to quantify spatial autocorrelation). Types include Ordinary Kriging, Simple Kriging, Universal Kriging, etc.
        * Spline: Deterministic, smooth surface interpolation. Good for gently varying phenomena. Parameters include spline type and tension.
        * Nearest Neighbor (Thiessen Polygons): Creates discrete zones around sample points. Not typically used for creating a continuous surface in the same sense as other methods, but useful in some contexts.

        Justification:

        * Method Choice Matters: Different methods have different assumptions and produce different results. The "best" method depends on the specific data and objectives.
        Kriging often preferred for soil properties: Because it explicitly models spatial autocorrelation, which is a fundamental characteristic of soil properties. It also provides estimates of prediction uncertainty.
        IDW as a simpler alternative or baseline: IDW is easy to implement and understand, useful as a comparison method or when Kriging assumptions are difficult to meet.
        * Parameter Tuning: Each method requires parameterization. These parameters significantly affect the interpolation outcome. Parameters should be chosen based on data characteristics and cross-validation (see step 6).

        Result Visualization and Mapping:

        * Explanation: Visualize the interpolated surface to examine the spatial patterns and assess the results visually. This involves:
        * Creating Raster Maps: Display the interpolated surface as a raster image with a color scale representing the soil property values.
        * Overlaying Sample Points: Plot the original sample locations on top of the interpolated raster to see how the interpolated surface relates to the original data.
        * Contour Maps (Optional): Generate contour lines to show gradients and levels of the soil property.
        
        Justification: Visualization is crucial for:

        * Qualitative Assessment: Visually inspect the smoothness, continuity, and overall spatial patterns of the interpolated surface. Does it make sense based on your understanding of the area and soil processes?
        * Identifying Artifacts: Detect potential interpolation artifacts or areas where the interpolation might be unreliable (e.g., bullseye effects around sample points, unrealistic sharp gradients).
        * Communication: Maps are a powerful way to communicate the results to stakeholders and understand spatial variability.

        ```

        Validation and Accuracy Assessment:

        * Explanation: Quantitatively assess the accuracy of the interpolation. Common validation techniques include:
        * Hold-Out Validation: Split the original dataset into training and validation sets. Interpolate using the training set and predict values at the locations of the validation set. Compare predicted values with actual values from the validation set.
        * Cross-Validation (e.g., Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation - LOOCV): For each sample point, temporarily remove it from the dataset. Interpolate using the remaining points and predict the value at the location of the removed point. Compare the predicted value with the actual value. Repeat for all sample points.
        
        Error Metrics: Calculate error metrics like:
        
        * Mean Error (ME): Indicates bias (over- or under-prediction on average). Ideally close to zero.
        * Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average magnitude of errors.
        * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE. Sensitive to outliers.
        * Correlation Coefficient (R): Measures the linear relationship between predicted and observed values.
        
        Justification: Validation is critical to:
        
        * Quantify Accuracy: Provides numerical measures of how well the interpolation method predicts soil property values at un-sampled locations.
        * Method Comparison: Allows for objective comparison of different interpolation methods or parameter settings to determine which performs best for your data.
        * Uncertainty Assessment: Provides an indication of the reliability of the interpolated surface. Higher accuracy (lower error metrics) implies a more reliable surface.

        Refinement and Iteration (Optional but Highly Recommended):

        * Explanation: Based on the validation results, you might need to refine your workflow. This could involve:
        * Parameter Tuning: Adjusting parameters of the chosen interpolation method (e.g., power parameter in IDW, variogram model and parameters in Kriging). Parameter tuning can be done manually or using optimization techniques (e.g., grid search to minimize RMSE in cross-validation).
        * Method Comparison: If validation shows poor performance with the initial method, try a different interpolation method.
        Data Re-evaluation: Revisit the EDA and preprocessing steps. Are there still outliers affecting the results? Was detrending effective? Could data transformations (e.g., log transformation) improve results?
        * Further Data Collection: If accuracy is still insufficient, consider whether additional sampling is needed, especially in areas with high spatial variability or sparse data.
        
        Justification: Geospatial analysis is often iterative. Refinement based on validation leads to improved interpolation accuracy and a more reliable final surface. It's important to not just accept the first result, but to critically evaluate and improve upon it.
        
        Example Iteration (Illustrative - Parameter Tuning for IDW Power Parameter):

            # Or use libraries like `verde` in Python which has more flexible IDW implementations.
        ```
        
        Final Output:

        The workflow results in:

        * A continuous raster surface: Representing the interpolated soil property values across the field.
        * Validation metrics: Quantifying the accuracy and reliability of the interpolation.
        * Visualization maps: For visual interpretation and communication of results.
        
        Important Considerations for Real-World Applications:

        * Variogram Modeling for Kriging: The provided Kriging code uses a default 'spherical' variogram model. In practice, proper variogram analysis (empirical variogram calculation and model fitting) is crucial for optimal Kriging results. Libraries like pykrige and gstools offer robust variogram modeling capabilities.
        * Computational Cost: Kriging can be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets. Consider efficiency and optimize code as needed. 
        * Software and Libraries: While Python is used here, other GIS software (like ArcGIS, QGIS) and statistical software (like R) also provide powerful tools for spatial interpolation. The choice depends on your specific needs, expertise, and available resources.
        * Data Quality: Emphasize the importance of high-quality input data. Errors in sampling, measurement, or georeferencing will propagate through the interpolation process and affect the accuracy of the final surface.
        * Domain Expertise: Soil science knowledge is essential to interpret the results, validate them against field observations, and understand the limitations of the interpolation.
        
        This detailed workflow and accompanying code provide a solid foundation for interpolating soil properties. Remember to adapt and refine the workflow based on the specific characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis.

"Thinking" models are also useful when there is a need to consider different options, for comparative analyses and for helping you weigh up the pros and cons of different methods and approaches to solving problems. Look at the example below that's considered the different methods for readiometric calibration of UAV multispectral images for a crop monitoring task. You can also see the reasoning capabilities of "thinking" models in the example above where the model considers the strengths and weaknesses of different spatial interpolation methods.

!!! note "Prompt"
    I am capturing UAV images over a paddock with the intention of estimating crop biophysical parameters such as leaf area index and chlorophyll content. I need to make sure the UAV images are radiometrically calibrated. 
    
    Can you review different radiometric calibration methods and assess their suitability for this task. The primary goal of this task is to obtain the highest quality multispectral images for subsequent crop biophysical parameter estimation.

    ??? note "Response (ChatGPT Reason)"
        Radiometric calibration is a crucial step in converting raw digital numbers (DN) from UAV multispectral images into actual surface reflectance values. This conversion is essential for accurately estimating crop biophysical parameters like leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content. Below is a review of several radiometric calibration methods and an assessment of their suitability for high-quality multispectral imaging in precision agriculture:

        **Empirical Line Calibration (ELC)**
        
        Overview:

        * Method: Establishes a linear relationship between the measured DN values in the image and known reflectance values obtained from calibration targets.
        * Process: Involves capturing images of ground-based calibration targets (often with known reflectance values measured using a spectroradiometer) during the UAV flight. A regression model is then computed to convert DN values to reflectance.
        
        Pros:

        * Direct and Robust: Provides a straightforward linear model that is robust when multiple targets across the reflectance range are used.
        * Accuracy: Can yield high accuracy if the calibration targets are well characterized and properly measured.
        
        Cons:

        * Field Dependency: Requires deploying and correctly positioning calibration panels in the field, which may add complexity and require extra fieldwork.
        * Sensitivity: Errors in the field measurements of target reflectance or panel degradation can propagate into the calibrated image.
        
        Suitability:

        * Highly suitable for crop biophysical parameter estimation when the necessary calibration targets are available and measured accurately. Its direct correlation with ground truth makes it a preferred method in many precision agriculture applications.
        
        **Reflectance Panel Calibration**
        
        Overview:

        * Method: Utilizes standardized reflectance panels (e.g., Spectralon) placed within the imaging area. These panels serve as in-scene references.
        * Process: UAV images include shots of the reflectance panels, and the known reflectance values of the panels are used to calibrate the image data.
        
        Pros:

        * In-Flight Calibration: Captures the same illumination conditions as the target field, making the calibration more representative of the flight conditions.
        * Consistency: When maintained properly, reflectance panels provide reliable, consistent reference data.
        
        Cons:

        * Logistics: Requires physical access to the field to place and retrieve the panels.
        * Environmental Sensitivity: Panels can be affected by dirt, damage, or improper placement, which may compromise calibration accuracy.
        
        Suitability:

        Very suitable for UAV-based agricultural imaging, especially when precise calibration is needed. This method is widely used in research and commercial applications where accurate reflectance is critical.
        
        **Sensor-Based (Factory or Onboard) Calibration**
        
        Overview:

        * Method: Relies on the camera's internal calibration data and sensor metadata, sometimes supplemented by onboard downwelling light sensors.
        * Process: The sensor’s inherent calibration parameters (provided by the manufacturer) are used to adjust raw imagery. Some UAV systems integrate incident light sensors to dynamically adjust for changing light conditions during flight.
        
        Pros:

        * Convenience: Eliminates the need for additional field calibration targets, reducing operational complexity.
        * Automation: Often integrated into the UAV’s processing pipeline, which can streamline data processing.
        
        Cons:

        * Limited Adaptability: May not fully account for real-time changes in illumination conditions or atmospheric variability.
        * Reliance on Manufacturer Data: Accuracy depends on the quality and stability of the sensor calibration provided by the manufacturer, which may degrade over time.
        
        Suitability:

        * Suitable for routine monitoring where small errors in reflectance are acceptable, but for high-precision estimation of crop biophysical parameters, this method might be less ideal unless validated with periodic ground measurements.
        
        **Vicarious Calibration**
        
        Overview:

        * Method: Uses naturally occurring targets or well-characterized reference sites (such as deserts or uniform surfaces) to adjust the imagery post-flight.
        * Process: The reflectance properties of a known, stable surface are used to calibrate the UAV imagery indirectly.
        
        Pros:

        * No Additional Equipment: Can be useful when deploying calibration panels is impractical.
        *Wide Applicability: Allows calibration even in remote or difficult-to-access areas.
        
        Cons:

        * Complexity: Requires careful selection of reference sites and sophisticated atmospheric correction models.
        * Uncertainty: Often less direct and can introduce additional uncertainties compared to on-site calibration methods.
        
        Suitability:

        * Generally less preferred for high-precision crop biophysical parameter estimation unless no other calibration method is feasible. It may serve as a backup when field calibration targets are unavailable.
        
        **Integrated Calibration Approaches**
        
        Overview:

        * Method: Combines multiple calibration techniques—for example, using reflectance panels with onboard sensor data and atmospheric corrections.
        * Process: Involves the integration of ground-based calibration targets, sensor metadata, and even atmospheric models to achieve the highest accuracy.
        
        Pros:

        * High Precision: By accounting for multiple sources of error, this approach can provide the most accurate reflectance data.
        * Robustness: Compensates for variations in lighting, sensor drift, and atmospheric conditions.
        
        Cons:

        * Complexity and Cost: Requires additional equipment, more complex data processing, and potentially higher operational costs.
        * Expertise: Demands a higher level of technical expertise to implement and validate.
        
        Suitability:

        * Most suitable when the highest quality multispectral images are required for precise estimation of crop biophysical parameters. This method is ideal for research and high-end commercial applications where data quality directly impacts decision-making.
        
        Conclusion
        
        For estimating crop biophysical parameters such as LAI and chlorophyll content, achieving high radiometric accuracy is critical. Reflectance Panel Calibration combined with Empirical Line Calibration is generally recommended due to its direct correspondence with field measurements and its robustness in accounting for in-flight illumination conditions. If available, integrating sensor-based calibration (with downwelling light sensors) further enhances accuracy by dynamically adjusting for changing light conditions. While vicarious calibration can be an alternative when field calibration is impractical, it typically does not provide the same level of precision needed for high-quality biophysical parameter estimation.

        Choosing the right method often depends on operational constraints, available equipment, and the required accuracy. For precision agriculture applications where the goal is to obtain the highest quality multispectral images, a combination of reflectance panel calibration and empirical line calibration (with sensor integration if possible) is the most robust approach.

        This assessment should help guide the selection of a calibration method that best fits your UAV imaging workflow for high-precision crop biophysical parameter estimation.

    You can upload an image to a multi-modal model and ask it to summarise the image or provide feedback on how to improve it. Use this feature to get ideas to improve the quality of your figures or maps. 

    This figure of a flood extent on Vanua Levu, Fiji, following Tropical Cyclone Yasa was uploaded to Gemini to get suggestions for how to convert it to a publication quality map and instructions for doing this in QGIS. 

    <img src="https://github.com/geog3300-agri3003/coursebook/raw/main/docs/img/vanua-levu-flood-map-s1.jpg" alt="Fiji flood map" width="100%">

    !!! note "Prompt"
        This is an image of flooding after Tropical Cyclone Yasa struck Vanua Levu in Fiji. The blue flood layer is computed from Sentinel-1 SAR images. I'd like to present this information as a publication quality map. Can you make suggestions for how to enhance this image so it is of publication quality?

        The flood layer is stored as a GeoTIFF file. Can you provide detailed instructions for how to use QGIS to visualise it as a publication quality figure.

        ??? note "Response (Gemini 2.0 Flash)"
            Absolutely! Let's transform this informative image into a publication-quality map using QGIS.

            **Enhancement Suggestions for Publication Quality**

            * Clear and Informative Title: Instead of just "Flooding after Tropical Cyclone Yasa," use a more descriptive title like "Extent of Flooding in [Specific Region] Vanua Levu, Fiji, Following Tropical Cyclone Yasa." Include the date of the cyclone for context.
            * Legend: A legend is crucial. It should clearly explain the meaning of the blue layer (e.g., "Flooded Areas"). Consider adding other relevant features to the legend, like settlements, rivers, etc., if they are included.
            * Scale Bar and North Arrow: Essential for spatial context.
            * Coordinate Grid/Graticule: Adds geographic reference.
            * Data Source Information: Include details about the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery (date acquired, sensor type, etc.) and the source of the flood layer.
            * Inset Map (Optional): Show the location of Vanua Levu within Fiji or the wider Pacific region.
            * Consistent Styling: Use consistent fonts, colors, and line weights throughout the map.
            * High Resolution Output: Export the map at a high DPI (dots per inch) for print publications.
            * Minimalist Design: Avoid clutter. Focus on conveying the essential information clearly.

            **Detailed QGIS Instructions**

            Import Data:

            * Open QGIS: Launch QGIS Desktop.
            * Add Raster Layer: Go to Layer > Add Layer > Add Raster Layer. Browse to your GeoTIFF file and open it.
            * Add Basemap (Optional but Recommended): Use the QuickMapServices plugin (Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins) to add a base map like Google Satellite or OpenStreetMap. This provides geographic context.
            
            Style the Flood Layer:

            * Double-click the Flood Layer: This opens the Layer Properties.
            * Symbology Tab:
                * Render Type: Ensure it's set to "Singleband pseudocolor" or "Paletted/Unique values" depending on your data.
                * Color Ramp: Choose a suitable color ramp for the blue flood layer. A simple blue gradient is often effective.
                * Opacity: Adjust the opacity if needed to see the underlying basemap.
                * Transparency Tab: If necessary, set a No Data value to make areas without flood data transparent.
            
            Create the Map Layout:

            * New Print Layout: Go to Project > New Print Layout. Give it a name.
            * Add Map: Click "Add Item" > "Add Map." Draw a rectangle where you want the map to appear.
            * Adjust Map Extent: Use the "Move item content" tool (under "Item Properties" when the map is selected) to pan and zoom the map to the desired area.
            * Add Scale Bar: Click "Add Item" > "Add Scale Bar." Place it on the map. Adjust the units and style in the "Item Properties."
            * Add North Arrow: Click "Add Item" > "Add North Arrow." Choose a style and place it on the map.
            * Add Grid/Graticule:
                * Select the map in the layout.
                * In "Item Properties," go to "Grids."
                * Click the "+" button to add a grid.
                * Adjust the grid interval, style, and frame options.
            * Add Legend: Click "Add Item" > "Add Legend." Place it on the map.
            * Uncheck "Auto update" to manually edit the legend items.
            * Remove unnecessary items and rename the flood layer item to "Flooded Areas" or a more descriptive name.
            * Add Title: Click "Add Item" > "Add Label." Type your title and adjust the font, size, and style in "Item Properties."
            * Add Data Source Information: Add another label for the data source details.
            
            Add Inset Map (Optional):

            * Add Another Map Item: Add a smaller map item to the layout.
            * Zoom to Fiji or the Pacific Region: Change the extent of this map to show the wider location.
            * Add a Rectangle to Indicate the Main Map Area: Use "Add Item" > "Add Shape" > "Add Rectangle" to draw a rectangle on the inset map showing the area covered by the main map.
            
            Style and Refine:

            * Font and Color Consistency: Ensure all text elements have consistent fonts and colors.
            * Line Weights: Adjust line weights for clarity.
            * Layout Alignment: Use the alignment tools in the layout to ensure elements are neatly arranged.
            
            Export the Map:

            * Export as Image or PDF: Go to Layout > Export as Image or Layout > Export as PDF.
            * Set DPI: For print publications, set the DPI (resolution) to 300 or higher.
            
            Additional Tips:

            * Use Plugins: Explore QGIS plugins for additional cartographic tools and features.
            * Reference Maps: Look at published maps from reputable sources for inspiration and best practices.
            * Iterate: Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and layouts until you achieve the desired result.
            
            By following these steps, you can create a clear, informative, and publication-quality map that effectively communicates the extent of flooding in Vanua Levu after Tropical Cyclone Yasa. Remember to tailor the map to the specific requirements of your publication. Good luck!

### AI literature and research tools 

There are numerous AI tools for literature and search tasks that take advantage of LLM’s long context windows, file upload features or are dedicated AI research and literature apps. 

#### Long context windows and file uploads

The most recent LLMs have long context windows (the amount of information you can provide to the model in your prompt). At the time of writing, Gemini 1.5 pro has a context window of 1 million tokens and GPT-4o has a context window of 128,000 tokens. A token is a representation of inputs provided to the LLM, 1 million tokens roughly corresponds to 8 novels or the transcripts of 200 podcasts (see <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/long-context" target="_blank">here</a>).

Alongside adding contextual information to a LLM’s chat interface (e.g. writing or copy and pasting prompts), you can upload text and image files. The LLM will process the information in these files and combine it with your written prompt when generating a response. 

!!! tip "Using long context windows"
    You can use the long context windows or file uploads to provide the LLM with extra information to use when generating your responses. Providing more contextual information:
    
    * can improve the accuracy, factuality and relevance of responses 
    * gives you a tool to summarise large amounts of text
    * allows you to interactively engage with reference material through iterative question and answer prompting 

!!! warning "Copyright and licensing"
    Be careful to consult the copyright or licensing of content you upload to AI tools and be extra careful with sharing AI generated content. 

#### Research and literature AI apps

Apps built on top of generative AI models can be used to:

* search for content and generate literature reviews
* generate wikipedia-like articles for arbitrary topics
* create podcasts discussing a paper (and you can join in the conversation)
* screen share and have a conversation with the AI as you read a paper asking it to explain concepts, equations or figures
* act as a note taking assistant
* generate study guides, quizzes and practice questions

!!! tip "Effective use of AI literature and research tools"

    **The key to AI enabled literature and research tools is using them to augment your existing reading, make your studying more efficient and effective, and enable active engagement with the literature.** 
    
    For example, generating a literature review on a topic before reading papers can:
    
    * give you an overview of the relevant background theory
    * help refresh your memory of key concepts
    * give you a structure to organise your thoughts and supplement with your own ideas as you read 
    
    Screen sharing and talking with AI as you read a paper allows you to:

    * actively engage with the content
    * break up the monotony of silent reading and mindless highlighting 
    * create and refine a mental model of the paper’s concepts and findings with the AI's feedback and support 
    * speed up your reading by asking the AI questions to clarify or explain aspects of a paper (e.g. equations or a chunk of text)

!!! tip "Diverse perspectives and active literature engagement with STORM and CO-STORM"
    STORM focuses on exploring topics from diverse perspectives, capturing different opinions on a topic and lets you discover new ideas and trails-of-thought that you would not have encountered following your own search and question-answering. STORM app authors describe this as helping users discover unknown-unknowns.

    You provide STORM with a prompt (e.g. a topic you'd like to know more about) and it will generate a Wikipedia-like article for you using the following process, focusing on the research and pre-writing stage:

    * AI-driven search to find relevant references and generate an article outline.  Two strategies are used to enhance this pre-writing research phase:
        * Diverse perspective-guided question answering: STORM uses an initial search to identify different perspectives on a topic and then uses these perspectives to guide question-answer information retrieval from articles on a topic. 
        * Simulated-conversations to iteratively build knowledge and understanding: STORM simulates a multi-turn conversation between a Wikipedia article writer and LLMs acting as topic experts with access to internet sources for grounding. Through this conversation the model updates its topic knowledge and refines follow-up questions. 
    * Using the retrieved sources and outline, the LLM writes a Wikipedia-like article. 

    While STORM focuses on generating Wikipedia-like articles, CO-STORM simulates a round-table conversation that you can observe and occasionally interject in. This lets you engage with and shape the knowledge discovery and information synthesising process. CO-STORM simulates a conversation between two LLM agents: experts who ask and answer questions from different perspectives and moderators who are non-experts and steer the conversation. The user can join the conversation at any time too. 
    
    * The act of asking questions allows you to actively engage with a topic, update your understanding of key concepts and develop new ideas.
    * CO-STORM can generate a mind-map of the discussion, comprising relationships between concepts, to give you a structure for thinking critically about a topic to guide further reading. 
    * CO-STORM can convert the mind-map of concepts, and associated information, generated through discussion into a report.

# Course outline

## Week 1

This week's lab will provide an introduction to programming concepts in Python:

* Python programs
* data types and structures
* variables
* control flow, loops, and conditional execution
* classes and objects

It will demonstrate these concepts by:

1) creating a Python program that runs as an AI-powered farm assistant using a large language model.
2) running a short Python program that loads crop yield data collected by harvesters from disk and visualises this data on interactive maps.

## Week 2

These labs introduce data visualisation concepts, creating interactive visualisations of this data, generating different figures to explore a dataset's structure and relationships between variables, using colour to highlight features and patterns in the dataset, and generating maps from spatial data.

    "## What is a figure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualisation is the process of relating data values to elements of a figure on a computer display. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *Grammar of Graphics* is an underlying model that describes the mapping of data values to the visual elements of a figure. It provides a consistent framework for guiding us in how to take our data values and convert them into a figure that effectively represents the data and conveys the messages and insights we seek to communicate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the *Grammar of Graphics* a plot comprises *data* and a *mapping*. The *mapping* (not cartographic here) is a formal description of how data values map onto elements of a figure. The elements of a figure are termed *aesthetics* and consist of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **layers** - geometric elements that represent data values such as points (e.g. for scatter plots), lines (e.g. for lines of best fit), and polyons (e.g. for histograms or bar plots).\n",
    "* **scales** - relate data values to visual display properties such as colour (e.g. a blue to red colour palette for temperature), size (e.g. larger points for larger numbers), position (e.g. location on axes), or shapes (e.g. using triangles for group A and circles for group B). Scales are used to draw axes and legends for figures. \n",
    "* **coords** - coordinate systems are used to map data values onto locations on the figure. On most 2D figures the x- and y-axes describe the coordinate space and on maps latitude and longitude describe the coordinate space (or you can use different coordinate reference systems). \n",
    "* **theme** - the background styling of the figure such as fonts for labels and background colours. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/geog3300-agri3003/coursebook/raw/main/docs/img/week-2-what-is-a-figure.jpg)\n",

    "Reading the <a href=\"http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A Layered Grammar of Graphics</a> paper by Hadley Wickham provides a detailed description of the core concepts for designing high-quality data visualisations. \n",

    "### Interactive visualisations\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive visualisations are important tools for exploring complex and multidimensional data. They enable users to quickly develop an understanding of a dataset's structure and patterns by enabling them to interactively generate different views of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, interactive visualisations are controlled by user input from mouse events (click, drag, hover), and, in response to mouse events, change what data and information is rendered on the computer display. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive visualisations are important tools for both exploratory analysis and for communicating the results of analysis to a wider audience. For exploratory analysis the quick feedback provided by interactive visualisations allows analysts to quickly build up an understanding of the datasets they are working with, spot noise or missing data, refine and develop hypotheses and research questions, and select suitable analytical and statistical tools for further work. Interactive visualisations are useful for communication as they enable active engagement with your datasets and the message you are conveying in a user friendly and non-technical manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will be using <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/\" target=\"_blank\">Plotly Express</a> to develop interactive visualisations. Plotly Express is a Python module that contains functions that convert data in Python programs into interactive visualisations that can be rendered in web browser based environments. \n",

    "* functions to generate a range of figure types to explore spatial and non-spatial data (see the <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/#gallery\" target=\"_blank\">gallery</a>)\n",

To avoid clutter we can create faceted figures where mutliple subplots of the same type are generated, which share axes, and different subsets (groups) of the data are rendered on each subplot. \n",

A key feature of a compound figure is that the subplots do not need to be arranged in a regular grid. The figures above with violin and box plots aligned on the margins of a scatter plot are examples of compound figures.\n",

    "## Using Colour\n",
    "\n",
    "A colour scale is used to map data values to colours on the display. <a href=\"https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-basics.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wilke (2019)</a> outline three uses of colour on figures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* colour to represent data values (e.g. using red shades for low precipitation and blue shades for high precipitation)\n",
    "* colour to distinguish groups (e.g. using green for forest on a land cover map, blue for water, orange-red for desert, etc.)\n",
    "* colour to highlight (e.g. using colour to highlight particular features on your visualisation)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Continuous palettes\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous colour scales can be either sequential or diverging and are typically used when using colour to represent data values (often numeric continuous variables). Continuous colour scales can be used to visualise variation in attributes of vector geospatial data on chloropleth maps and variation in attributes of raster data as surfaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequential palettes\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequential colour scale is a palette which consists of single hue such as light green to dark green or light red to dark red. Multi-hue sequential colour scales often consist of hues that imply an intuitive and increasing order to the colours such as light yellows to dark red.\n",

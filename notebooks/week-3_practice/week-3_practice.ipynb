    "# Week 3 - Practice Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains practice exercises related to week 3's content on working with file systems and directories and reading data from files into Python programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises are based on vector data products that delineate the extent of disaster and emergency event impacts. These products are generated by the <a href=\"https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/list-of-activations-rapid\" target=\"_blank\">European Commission Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) - Rapid Mapping Activations</a> to aid with disaster response. The EMS Rapid Mapping Activations include vector geospatial data delineating the extent of the event impact and ancillary spatial data layers relevant to disaster response (e.g. infrastructure, land use). They also include a high-quality cartographic product depicting the event impact (in a PDF or JPEG format).\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector data for Tropical Cyclone Yasa has been obtained and stored in the folder *data_lab-3_practice*. In these exercises you will need to read this vector data from files into your Python program and check the data was read in correctly. Please refer to the <a href=\"https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/list-of-components/EMSR489\" target=\"_blank\">Tropical Cyclone Yasa (EMSR489: Fiji, 2020)</a> information page to find out about the disaster event and the data products.\n",

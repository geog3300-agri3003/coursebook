### AI and plagiarism

UWA's Academic Integrity Policy states that using AI generated content, without citation, counts as plagiarism.

## AI and bias

LLMs can generate biased responses; this might reflect biases in the models training data. For example, models may generate different responses given different geographic, cultural, demographic or socio-economic contexts. You can mitigate some biases in LLM responses by effective prompting; however, the risk of biased responses remains. You should carefully review responses for bias and be alert to this issue. 

Read this paper that highlights some the <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.02680" target="_blank">geographic biases in LLMs</a>.

## AI and private and personal data

You should not reveal personal or private data to hosted LLMs (e.g. LLMs that you access from chatgpt.com or gemini.google.com). Where possible, you should turn off data sharing with hosted LLM and AI tool providers and select options that prevent your data being used to train models. However, taking that step doesn't necessarily mean you can share personal or private data with hosted LLMs. Some steps you can take to working with LLMs and personal or private data are:

* Uunderstanding what counts and personal or private data
* Use a LLM to generate a fake dataset that mimics the structure of your private data, and solve the problem working with the fake dataset
* Use a local LLM or a LLM running in a computational environment you control. See this example for setting up and running your own LLM using [Hugging Face and Google Colab](hugging-face-and-colab-setup.md)

## AI, licensing and copyright

You should not upload content to AI tools unless permitted by the content's licensing or copyright, and you should not share AI generated response that are based on uploaded content that's licensing or copyright prohibits this use.

# Course outline

## Week 1

This week's lab will provide an introduction to programming concepts in Python:

* Python programs
* data types and structures
* variables
* control flow, loops, and conditional execution
* classes and objects

It will demonstrate these concepts by:

1) creating a Python program that runs as an AI-powered farm assistant using a large language model.

2) running a short Python program that loads crop yield data collected by harvesters from disk and visualises this data on interactive maps.

## Week 2

These labs introduce data visualisation concepts, selecting different figures to explore a dataset's structure and relationships between variables, using colour to highlight features and patterns, and generating maps from spatial data. You will be working with crop yield data sampled by a header on a harvester from a field in the Western Australia and satellite images from the same field. 

1) introduction to data visualisation and creating interactive figures.

2) geospatial data visualisation of raster and vector data.

3) practice exercises generating interactive visualisations using Plotly Express from an Our World in Data article: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-habitat-loss" target="_blank">*To protect the world’s wildlife we must improve crop yields – especially across Africa*</a>.

## Week 3 

These labs will provide an introduction to file formats for tabular, vector, and raster data; best practice for reading and writing spatial and non-spatial data in Python programs; navigating directories and file systems; and, identifying suitable file formats for different tasks, use cases, contexts (e.g. big data / web environments). You will be working with a range of datasets including satellite images, climate reanalysis products, and crop yield data collected by a harvester from a field in Western Australia.

1) data I/O and file formats.

3) practice exercises reading and writing vector data to different formats working with flood maps generated by the European Commission Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) - Rapid Mapping Activations.

## Week 4

These labs focus on data wrangling and data transformation. You will implement a range of data transformation and geoprocessing operations including map algebra, spatial and non-spatial data subsetting, zonal statistics, and combining datasets. One lab will focus on raster data and build a data processing workflow to convert satellite images into flood maps following a tropical cyclone event in Fiji. The second lab will turn a satellite image into a vector-tabular dataset of field boundaries with a crop type label and field-average spectral reflectance values. This demonstrates how we can process satellite images into a format ready for machine learning model development. 

1) data wrangling: raster data.

3) practice exercises performing a range of geometry operations to generate zones for zonal statistics operations to compute summary statistics describing areas flooded and not flooded after a tropical cyclone in event in a satellite image.
